# Sonic-EEG-Blockchain-Powered-Brainwave-AI-Model

# Introduction: 

An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a diagnostic procedure that assesses the electrical activity of the brain. Commonly referred to as an EEG, this test employs small metal discs known as electrodes, which are affixed to the scalp. 

# EEG Brainwave AI Model
EEG is essential in the field of neuroscience, allowing for the evaluation of cognitive states through the analysis of brainwave patterns. This model introduces a computational method that:

- Simulates EEG signals, 
- Employs Fourier Transform for spectral analysis, and 
- Incorporates artificial intelligence to categorize predominant brain states. 

By producing synthetic EEG waveforms that align with Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma frequency bands, this model replicates authentic neural activity and cognitive functions.

The incorporation of artificial intelligence significantly improves the conventional interpretation of EEG data by automating the identification of mental states, including sleep, relaxation, concentration, and stress.

# How Sonic (SonicBlaze) Plays A Role:

## Decentralized Biomarker Verification – 
The blockchain framework guarantees that EEG-derived biomarkers (such as frequency bands and event-related potentials) can be accessed without reliance on centralized trust mechanisms.

## Enhancing Predictive Neuroscience Models – 
Sonic promotes ongoing learning and refinement of EEG-based machine learning models by enabling users to update model accuracy through smart contracts.

## Cross-Disciplinary Interoperability – 
This integration connects computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology, establishing innovative avenues for secure neurodata storage and collaborative AI model training.

## AI-Enhanced Neuroimaging with Blockchain – 
The EEG data preserved on the blockchain has a direct impact on MRI visualizations, linking bioelectrical activity stored on the blockchain with structural neuroimaging methodologies.

# How Sonic Influeences The Model
The hotspots (red areas) in the MRI, seen below, where EEG activity is most influenced.

The cooler (blue areas) represent weaker but present blockchain-modulated EEG signals.
The image below shows the accuracy scale (0.99 in this case), proving Sonic’s direct influence (higher accuracy = stronger activations).

This means that as the AI model improves (via blockchain updates), the EEG activations will get more defined in future scans.


# Sonic-Integrated EEG MRI Visualization & Model Accuracy Updater App

## Accuracy Update Procedure  

- The user provides a new accuracy percentage.
  
- The transaction is authenticated with a private key.  

- The updated accuracy value is permanently recorded in Sonic Blaze. 
 
- Subsequent AI models access historical accuracy data for comparative analysis.  

## Smart Contract for Accuracy Modifications  

The contract stipulates: 

- Only users with authorization are permitted to modify accuracy.  

- Accuracy values are permanently stored.  

- Historical accuracy records can be accessed.
